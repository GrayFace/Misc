-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Update Version 1.1 Information


Recharging Mr. Malwick's wand no longer gives the incorrect charge
range.  The fix also corrects this problem in saved games.
 
Wands found on the ground now have the proper amount of charges.  This
will result in no wands showing up with "0" charges.  This will prevent 
the wands from disappearing when first used by a party member.  These 
wands can also be recharged by a spell or potion if the base charge is 
greater than one. The fix also corrects this problem in saved games.

The backpack no longer causes corruption, crashes or item duplication.
The fix also corrects this problem in saved games.

The spear now causes the correct amount of damage with bonuses at expert
level. The fix also corrects this problem in saved games.

No invisible monsters will spawn in the Arena. 

Corrected the loading of different saved games that would infrequently
cause the character portraits to drop for the second, third, and 
fourth characters.

Corrected Necromancer and Mages that would occasionally summon
incorrect monsters.  Necromancer can summon only Ghosts and Mages can 
summon only Light Elementals.

Looking through the character inventory/spellbook in "The Pit" will 
no longer cause an internal error.  The fix also corrects this problem 
in saved games.

The "Kill the Griffin" quest can be completed in all instances. The 
fix also corrects this problem in saved games.

The NPC Master Healer no longer wipes out the armor skills of the 
party.  The fix prevents this issue from reappearing in saved games,
but does not restore previouly lost skills or points.

The lich jars now appear in their correct location in the "Walls
of Mist".  They will be there regardless of restarting or loading
from a previously saved game.

The phantom "0" quest that may appear in the Quest Notes doesnot 
affect gameplay.

Any error message that occurs when traveling from one area to another
has been rectified.  The fix also corrects this problem in saved 
games.

Conditional effects no longer appear on duplicate party member
portraits when only one has been affected.

The ambush event in Deyja no longer occurs repeatedly.

Minor text bugs were also addressed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  New Features

Right clicking on skills in the character skills screen will show which 
Skills the character can learn at his current promotion (white), skills 
he could potentially learn at a following promotion (yellow), and skills 
he will never be able to learn (red).  It will also show the total bonus 
to the skill from NPCs or items.

Protection from Magic (master level Body spell) also protects against 
the Eradication condition at Grandmaster level.

Training takes one week per level per visit, to a maximum of the number 
of times any one single character trains.

Toggling colored lights (Video Options; hardware only) requires the 
Level to be reloaded to take effect.

The gamma setting can be changed in the Video Options submenu under 
the Controls option in the options menu (Esc command).  Note: Must

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)  Video Card And Other Hardware Drivers / Direct X

If you experience problems running Might and Magic VII, make 
sure you have the latest drivers for your audio and video card. 
Video and Sound card manufacturers regularly update their software 
drivers to enhance performance and stability, and to improve 
compatibility with DirectX.  You can find links to many of these 
manufacturers' sites by going to the Driver Updates section of our 
support web site, which is located at http://www.3do.com/support. 

You may obtain a list of Microsoft-certified video and audio drivers for 
your hardware by going to http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest/hcl/.  Drivers 
listed here are confirmed to be compatibility with Windows 95, Windows 98
and Windows NT 4.0. 

Microsoft updates DirectX and its components regularly and posts them for
download off of their web site at http://www.microsoft.com/DirectX.  

Issues regarding the hardware acceleration.

The Voodoo 3(TM) in windowed mode does not correctly display the water 
tiles' mipmaps.  Running in full screen will rectify this. Alt-Tab
command may cause the screen to flicker in full screen.  This can be
corrected by switching to windowed mode (F4 key) and then switching
back to full screen (F4 key).

The Voodoo 2 must have it's latest DirectX 6 drivers.  The mouse 
cursor may experience flickering, but doesn't impact gameplay.  
If changing the gamma settings through the display properties, 
be sure to exit Might and Magic VII first.

The Permedia(TM) 2 currently reports that it has all the features required 
to run Might and Magic VII, but has problems with our lighting model.  
Run in software mode if any problems occur.

The Ticket To Ride(TM) has a choppy mouse on some machines.

Rendition Verite(TM) V2200 and the SIS6326 chipsets currently only run 
in full screen.

The nVidia(TM) Riva128 and Riva128zx(TM) are not supported.  Only run in 
software mode.

The Intel740(TM) chipset based AGP graphics card on non-Intel motherboards 
may experience problems in hardware.  Suggest running in software mode.

If any audio issues occur when using Accelerated 3D Audio, changing to 
the 'Microsoft Sound 3D hardware support' or disabling the Accelerated 
3D Audio may resolve them.
 
Might and Magic VII will run on Windows NT 4.0 service pack 4 in 
software only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6)   Windows, Virtual Memory, and Hard Disk Space

The Windows operating system requires a certain amount of virtual 
memory to function properly. The amount of virtual memory required by 
Windows varies depending on how much of your computer's resources are 
required by an application.  Might and Magic VII, like most 
other games, requires the use of most of your computer's resources to 
run properly.

Therefore, for a Windows application like Might and Magic VII to 
run properly there must be sufficient free space on the hard disk with 
your Windows system folder.  You should keep enough free hard disk space 
equal to the larger of: two times the total amount of RAM your computer 
has; or, 10% of the space on the hard drive with Windows.

Note: Might and Magic VII requires 375MB Megabytes (minimum) free 
hard drive space on the destination drive and at least 1 MB of free 
space on your C:\ drive.

New World Computing or 3DO game, GameUpdate(TM) can automatically download

other recent New World Computing or 3DO products installed on your

8)   Troubleshooting

Installation 

Problem: 	
	The CD is in the CD-ROM drive, but the computer is not 
	recognizing it. 
Answers: 	
	The CD may be dirty or scratched.
Solutions: 	
	1. Make sure that the data side of the CD (shiny side) is not 
	dirty or scratched.  If it is dirty, take a lint free 
	non-abrasive cloth and wipe gently to clean it (always wipe from 
	the inside of the CD to the outside edges).  If the data side of 
	the CD appears to be scratched, return the game to the store that
	you bought it from, and exchange it for a new copy. If you are 
	unable to exchange the game at the store that you bought it from,
	please call Customer Support for information on our exchange 
	policy.

Problem:	
	The computer freezes during install, or you receive an error 
	message (such as "*_ins error" or "An error has occurred during 
	the move data process") during install.
Answers: 	
	Your computer may be using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver; or 
	there may not be enough space on your hard drive for temporary 
	files to expand; or the CD-ROM drive might be having problems 
	with how it buffers information. Or, the Autorun or DMA settings 
	on your CD-ROM drive could be interfering with the game 
	installation.

To check and see if your computer is using an older 16-bit CD-ROM driver:
	1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 'Properties'.
	2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
	3. In the Performance status box, if the File System line says  
	"Some drivers are using MS-DOS compatibility", you are using a 
	16-bit CD-ROM driver.
Solutions:	
	1. For 16-bit CD-ROM drivers: Contact the manufacturer of your 
	CD-ROM drive or the manufacturer of your computer for an updated
	32-bit CD-ROM driver.

	2. For 32-bit CD-ROM drivers:
		1. Close all unnecessary programs running in the 
		Background.  Press the CTRL+ALT+DEL keys at the same time
		to open the Close Program window, select a program, and 
		press the End Task button.  Repeat this process until all
		programs except 'Explorer' and 'Systray' are closed.
	
		2. Delete all files in your C:\Windows\Temp folder, then 
		empty the Recycle Bin.

	3. Turn off read-ahead on the CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right-click on the 'My Computer' icon and select 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Performance' tab.
		3. Click on the 'File System' button.
		4. Choose the 'CD-ROM' tab at the top
		5. Change the 'Optimize access pattern for' field to 
		   'No read-ahead'
		6. Click on Apply, then OK and finally click Close (you 
		   will be prompted to restart your system).

	4. Turn off the Autorun and DMA settings on your CD-ROM drive:
		1. Right click on the 'My Computer' icon and choose 
		   'Properties'.
		2. Click on the 'Device Manager' tab.
		3. Click on the '+' sign next to the CD-ROM line so that 
		   it becomes a '-' sign.
		4. Click on the line that appears under the CD-ROM line 
		   so that it is highlighted, then click on the 
		   'Properties' button.
		5. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
		6. Look for the Auto-insert Notification and DMA lines.  
		   If there is a check mark in the boxes next to either 
		   of these lines, click on the box to remove the check 
		   mark.
		7. Click on the 'Apply' button, and then click on the 
		   'OK' button.
		8. When you are asked if you want to restart your system,
		   choose 'Yes'.
