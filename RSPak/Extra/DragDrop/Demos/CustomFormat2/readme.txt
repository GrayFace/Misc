CustomFormat2

This application demonstrates how to define and use custom data formats.

The custom format used in this demo contain the time-of-day and a color value.
A custom clipboard format, TTimeOfDayClipboardFormat, is implemented to support
this data format. In addition two new components, TDropTimeOfDayTarget and
TDropTimeOfDaySource, are implemented, but they are not used by this demo.

This demo is more complex than CustomFormat1 demo, but also demonstrates how to
implement and use custom Clipboard Format and Data Format classes and Target and
Source components.

To see the custom data format in action, drag from the source window and
drop on the target window. You can also do this between multiple instances of
any of the CustomFormat demo applications.
